1. Place the entire folder in your /modules directory, or a /modules directory
    in a mulitsite folder.
2. Enable the module at administer -> site building -> modules.
3. Visit administer -> user management -> access control, and grant users
   permissions to either add/remove protections for single users, or to
   administer the module settings.
4. Visit administer -> user management -> userprotect settings, and set the default
    protections for individuals and roles, and any other settings changes you
    desire.
5. Protection by roles takes effect immediately.  To individually protect a user,
    visit administer -> user management -> protected users.

Upon initial module installation, the anonymous user and the root user receive
protection from status changes and deletion.
